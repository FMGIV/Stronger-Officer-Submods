        "description": "The bells of Rome had already tolled before I arrived. I stood by the banks of the Tiber, watching that flag rise—an irrelevant bystander. I once promised others: either Rome, or death. Now I have attained neither. Those who entered the city before me will embrace each other in some square, commemorating their courage, while my name will be forgotten. This is not the worst ending—the worst is that I am still alive, still breathing, still able to see the sun rise over the Apennines each dawn, yet I have no right to enter that city gate. I tell myself: I still have a Rome I have never seen. Fortunately, fate has left me some room. Rome is liberated, but the world is not yet free. War still burns elsewhere—in every inch of land not yet touched by the dawn. This time, I will walk with many: Americans, French, and those old adversaries from Britain—those who have been both enemy and friend. I believe I will eventually see your figure on the battlefield north of the Alps, just like all those who missed Rome. Fate always loves such jokes, doesn't it?\n\n—A letter to the Exile, Anzio, Italy, 1944",
